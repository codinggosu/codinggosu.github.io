### Summary of Original Goals

- spilling: nemo lacked a spilling mechanism to spill data to disk when there wasn't enough memory, implementing a spill function for nemo would prevent certain OOMs

- caching: allowing the user to program applications without explicitly specifying which data to cache would be beneficial, an autocaching feature can also help achieve better efficiency

#### What is Done

- The block spill feature has been implemented with unit tests/default integration tests completed
  
- The autocaching feature has been partially implemented with design on how to identify identical and reusable edges


#### TODO
- The block spill feature currently has certain shortcomings such as spilling an entire block to disk. Augmenting this with features such as: 

  1. creation of a new type of block i.e. `HybridBlock` that has data in both disk and memory
  2. Better handling of distributed states such as machine failure during spill, picking up from failed states, etc
  3. Ensuring correctness with large scale, distributed testing
- Autocaching needs to be completed with actual caching and ensuring correctness and efficiency improvement with the addition of caching
